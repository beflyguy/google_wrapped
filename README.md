# Google Wrapped

One day I stumbled across the ability to download all your Google Data. Like, all of it. Every YouTube search, every location your phone ever visited, even down to the apps you open on your phone (if you have an Android).

Wouldn't it be cool to aggregate this data into a wrapper and showcase it like Spotify does your listening data? It'd also open users' eyes into the sheer amount of tracking Google is doing.

This project will be ongoing, as I plan to first ingest and analyze a few sections of the files, hopefully presenting them in a _dash_ python dashboard.
